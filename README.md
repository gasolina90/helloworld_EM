# Overview

The purpose of this document is to give the reader an idea of what is come of the software engineer Erick Morales. Many programs seen here will be small but effecient since the later repositories will demostrate proof of concepts in various programming languages and coding techniques.

The humble `hello.py` program is shown here to display the words "Hello world!" in the Python programming language. A staple in introductory programs. 

The purpose of this specific program serves as a proof of concept of the ability to create, as well as push and commit changes to a Distributed Version Control System (DVCS) such as Github. Below you will find a link to a short Youtube video walking through how the code executes and the result.
